SSS. Similar to [[state_maintainers]] seats (SMS). This seat is used for hosting nodes. 

Because network bandwidth issue, we have to only allow a certain mount of hosting nodes to connect to limited number of [[state_maintainers]]. Those limit is enforced by the State Subscription Seat. 

The seat is limited public resource. Who owns these seat need to pay the coresponding tax to be fair. This tax is called State Subscription Tax (SST).
