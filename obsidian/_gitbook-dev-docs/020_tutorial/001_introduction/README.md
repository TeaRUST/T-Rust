# Introduction
Developing a TApp is very similar to developing a typical web2 application. You do not need to learn smart contract, or understand the concept of distributed system. But there are still many differences. This tutorial is here to help you overcome those challenges. 

During this tutorial, we will step by step build a simple TApplication. It is called **Tutor-v1"**. It looks a typical "todo list" example we have seen so many times in various web framework tutotiral. But we have a little improvement. The worker who complete  task will get paid by the owner who created such a task.

During our tutorial, we will 
- Setup the development environment. 
- Clone from the boilerplate. 
- Test locally using dev-runner.
- Deploy to the testnet
- Gradually add features to the app
- Summary

After following the full tutorial, you should be able to create your own TApps by adding your own business logic to the boilerplace. But you may need more detail explanation, you will need to read our development document.

## Try before build

TODO://
George, please add a paragraph here, telling the reader how to run the tutor-v1 on our testnet. 
Use the screenshots and user workflow. You can take screenshot from the nitro deployment at http://43.201.23.47:8080/ipfs/QmberYsF6kSVbrxzp1DZuMtcZTfvCWG13ZePLi4PVcHyY8/#/discover

but we will have tutor-v1 deployed to the wallet.teaproject.org too. but not tonight.

Tell step by step how to use this tutor-v1 app. 

The full work flow has been explained in the 6.0 reward. Please use the same workflow.
