You probably thought that there would be a lot of code changes in the sample-txn-executor project, but you are surprisingly wrong. There is almost no change in the txn executor actor. There is nothing the developer need to do to execute the secure oracle. Comparing with this step and last step, the new added business logic all happens inside the hosting node, that means the sample-actor project. Originally in our previous step, the task owner need to click a button to confirm the worker job completion. In this step, this "confirmation" is done by the secure oracle automatically. The secure oracle will call the twiter API to verify if the worker actually successfully retweets. 

All the secure oracle workflow is transparent to the developers. You, as a developer only need to create a OracleHttpRequest and call. In our future developer document, there will be more OracleSomethingRequest published. We will open the code base so that you can write your own OracleYourselfRequest to run different oracles. Furthermore, what your actor can earn TEA token for you if someone calls your actor. Our billing system will measure the usage, and the caller will pay you. Note, your code, your actor is an NFT, and you are the owner of this NFT. Your NFT works for you and make you profit. Is that amazing?
