# Local Dev & Test Environment
TEA Project provides a local development environment to simulate the distributed running environment locally.

The local development environment (LDE) i s a docker configuration. It simulates one hosting node and one state machine node. It's running in your local computer under docker. There 's' no hardware protection, so all Remote Attestation and consensus are simulated.
