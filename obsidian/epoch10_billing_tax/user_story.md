# Buy maintainer seat to become a maintainer
In our first two years period, the core team will run all [[Global_state_maintainer_nodes]] as a temporary security solution. This period may reduce if we are confident. During this period, everyone buy a [[Maintainer_Seat]] to "literally" own a seat and become a maintainer. But he doesn't need to setup a node. But he owns the income from as a maintainer. 

The trade of [[Maintainer_Seat]] is in [[marketplace_trade_maintainer_seat]].

Based on the rules:
- Seats are always on sell
- If the seat is owned by the DAO, the price is zero. 
- If the seat is owned by others, the price is owner (maintainer) [[self_estimate_price]]
- transfer happens at the end of every day (Block time, may not be exact matching human time)

# Our active testers in testnet rewarded the initial maintainer seat in the Genesis block

At the genesis block, all seats are available at price of zero. We will give those seats to our predefined community members who helped us during testnet. They have the advantage to own those nodes at zero cost as long as they pay the [[maintainer_tax]]. They can sell the seat at any time if they do not want to be a maintainer any more. But if someone else want to buy his seat, he may need to increase the [[self_estimate_price]] and pay more tax.
