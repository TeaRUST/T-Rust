This is a system buffer account. It stored the fund before paying to the Public Services and Global Token dividend.

At the end of every day, a cron job dump all fund from [[Collection Pool]] to this Distribution_pool. If the balance is higher than the 1000T (this number is subject to change), it will send exceed fund to [[Global_bonding_curve]] as dividend to all Global token investors. If the balance is lower than 1000T, the sudo will transfer the difference from [[Genesis_block_miner_reward_reserve]] to keep the balance to 1000T. In this case, there is no dividend for today.
