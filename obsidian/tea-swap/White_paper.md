TEA Swap is a decentralized asset exchange (DEX) that runs an [[Automatic Market Maker(AMM)]] to trade any [[fungible_assets]] instantly. It is not an **order book** type exchange. Instead, it runs similar to Uniswap algorithm but different in many ways:
- TEA Swap is not a smart contract, it doesn't run on blockchain. Therefore its gas fee is almost zero, and settled instantly.
- TEA Swap works with any fungible tokens, no limited to ERC20, nor blockchain based assets. Those assets could be fiat or CBDC as long as it supports [[decentralized_escrow]].
