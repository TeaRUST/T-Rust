> Q: Do we still need to show My total investment value in TEA?

No matter saved or not, the TAppStore is system app. its token is always listed at the top position.

Note: 
1. Investing CML and invest TApp are the same
2. Investing to AppStore is investing to the platform. We can probably call it Platform in the token (or Global as we called internally)
3. We do not provide the hosting feature to State Machine so far.
