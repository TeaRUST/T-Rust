At early stage of the TEA Project, the tapp is very active, the memory tax is low. So the maintainer income tax is low too. There might not be enough fund to support public service. In this case, the reserved [[pre_mined]] TEA token should be used to pay the public service. This reserved token is limited and will be run off eventually. After run off, we supposed the memory tax is strong enough to support the system running.
