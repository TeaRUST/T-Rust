State machine actors code runs inside a state maitainer node. The app owner needs to pay for the cost of computing. Because every node of the [[Global_state_maintainer_nodes]] will run a copy of the same code, so the price of state machine actor is significantly higher than the hosting actor, given the hosting actor code runs on a single hosting node.
