In epoch2, we can discconnect the link between real usd and test tea token.
By the end of epoch11, we will ask everyone to exchange coffee to USD. because after that, we will no longer exchange to real USD.

# Faucet in Email
If there is no connection, we can use faucet to give away test TEA token.  If our email oracle is ready, we can use that as an **Invitation only** TEA token giveaway.

A new tester need to find anyone already in the testnet to send him an email to receive the initial TEA token. The existing inviter will send email to this new tester a certain amount of test TEA. the new tester receive email, runnin OTP, claimed the TEA token. Then he can transfer to his metamask then use as regular user. After that, he can invite others using the same way by sending email.

We can pay some subsidy when inviting others using email.

We can setup a web page, ask new tester to fill in a form with email. Then we reply the email with test TEA Token.

Every email can be used only once. 
# Uniswap Goerli ETH <> Test TEA
Since there is no connection, we can setp Goerli ETH <> Test TEA trading pair on Uniswap.

If no one exchange TEA to Goerli ETH, will it make the TEA price going higher and higher?

# Faucet in ETH Address
This is a question. Do we allow them to input an ETH address to receive free test TEA token?

If so, how do we control the flow rate?
