## Node Subsidy 
Every running node (hosting node or state maintainer node) will have a basic income to cover around 80% of the cost. This is considered a subsidy for node running at the early stage, assuming the gas income and tax income cannot cover their operation cost.

If the TAppStore accrued fund cannot cover, DAO reserve will be used to fill this pool. This is what the DAO Reserve was designed for.

## Maximum Node Subsidy
The maximum node subsidy is calculated based on:

- How many nodes are running.
- What's the current cost (in the early stages, the cost will be the rental price for an AWS Nitro instance).

The percentage that node costs are subsidized (such as 80%) is set and adjusted by the DAO.
