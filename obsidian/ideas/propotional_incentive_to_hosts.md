This pool is usually the last pool in sequence. because it can use up all TAppStore accured balance (expcet a minimal level left in the accrued balance)

It shares all the remaining revenue to all current running nodes.

We cannot share those revenue to all TEA token holder for legal reason. But share to those who do the work would be ok. So we share them to all working nodes based on how much they contributed during last period (we use daily for now). If a node has done more work the past day, the more reward he will received.
