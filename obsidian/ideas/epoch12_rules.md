## Epoch 11

-   TEA<>COFFEE Uniswap LP on Goerli setup by team for contestants to use.
-   Any TEA in contestants wallets (layer-1 and layer-2) rolls over to Epoch 12.
-   Any bonding curve assets will be proportionally calculated for each user, the TEA value of which gets rolled over to Epoch 12.
-   Any deposits for state maintainer seats will get rolled over to Epoch 12 in TAppStore wallet.
-   Any COFFEE, whether purchased by themselves through the form, carried over from previous epoch, or converted themselves via the Uniswap LP, will get carried over at a ratio of 1:1.2 (i.e. a 20% bonus) into Epoch 12 or cash out to BUSD before Epoch12 starts. Please note, you need to make decision to cash out or roll over **before** epoch12 starts. Once roll over is decided, there will not be cash out option later.
-   Once epoch12 starts, there's no option for COFFEE cash out to USDT / BUSDT. In future epoches, the COFFEE cannot cash outto BUSD. They will be used to convert to discount mainnet TEA token when mainnet starts. More detail on this later.
-   We should emphasize to them that the asset they want is COFFEE not TEA, i.e. TEA is just a means to get COFFEE which is what they want to get discounted mainnet tokens. 
- Have we promisted to reward COFFEE for epoch11 contesters yet? I do not remember.

## Epoch 12

-   Team does **not** setup Uniswap LP for TEA<>COFFEE, meaning COFFEE is a terminal voucher for discounted mainnet TEA.
- Team will setup Goerli ETH <>TEA, Goerli USDT<>TEA in Uniswap. 
- There is no COFFEE (half half with TEA) initialized to contesters any more. For those decide to roll over COFFEE will have their COFFEE (with 20% bonus) in their Goerli wallet. There is no cash out once epoch12 starts. 
- For those TEA token rolled over from epoch11, they will appear in the contester's TAppStore wallet when epoch 12 starts. 
-   Total reward pool for COFFEE in Epoch 12 will be 1000 COFFEE( This number 1000 to be determined. it may be a vaiable based on how many contesters join the leaderboard). The reward will be distributed proportionally based on the net gain shown in the leaderboard. Only position net gain is considered valid. Those rewarded COFFEE will be sent to contesters COFFEE balance. The minimal COFFEE reward is 1 COFFEE. If you reward is less than 1 COFFEE, it is ignored.
-   All TEA / TEA-equivalent assets will be wiped clean at end of Epoch 12. When next epoch starts, everyone will starts from zero TEA balance.
- All contesters COFFEE assets will be kept and accumulated to the mainnet starts. They can use these COFFEE to exchange discounted mainnet TEA token as reward for the testing work. This is **not** airdrop. It is reward to your hard work. 

## Epoch 13
- No TEA is rolled over from previous epoch.
- No COFFEE to any other stable coin redeem, convert, cash out.
- All contesters COFFEE will stay in their own Goerli wallet.
- Team will not setup COFFEE <> TEA exchange.
- At the end of epoch 13, all TEA assets will be clear and reset. Contesters will get COFFEE reward at the end. There might be a new reward plan.
