At early stage, new user may not have any TEA to start, and they are not likely to buy some TEA. 
We should use TEA Fluencer of other faucet marketing campaign to giveaway some TEA token to new users. This pool is used for this purpose.

## Max level
A const value that can be changed by DAO

## Running out daily limit
Because the pool is refilled daily, if it runs out, the new user will need to get the TEA from faulcet the next day.This is one way to reduce the flow for cost control. If we have other better solution, we do not have to do this.
