In epoch11, only y=sqft(x) curve is selected to all apps. I am thinking to provider different types of curve for devs to select when create new entity.

At least we should provder three basic options with customize possibility
- fiat curve. the price of token is fixed
- current sqrt curve with theta allow to be 0 to 100. currently max is 30
These options are for the CMLs and new Apps.

For the system tapps. (tappstore, leaderboard, harberger, miner, seeds auction) will be used non-bonding curve divideds.
