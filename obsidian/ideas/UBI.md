Universal basic income. 
Every running node (hosting node or state maintainer node) will have a basic income to cover around 80% of the cost. This is considered a subsidy for node running at the early stage, assuming the gas income and tax income cannot cover their operation cost.

If the TAppStore accrued fund cannot cover, DAO reserve will be used to fill this pool. This is what the DAO Reserve was designed for.

## The max level of UBI
This number is calculated based on 
- How many nodes are running
- How much is the current cost. (at early stage, it is the cost of AWS Nitro rental)

This factor number (such as 80%) is set and adjusted by the DAO.
