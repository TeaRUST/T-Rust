To avoid potential security token compliants, we can set our own system taps to not using Global token or any bonding curve token. But we allow any community members (miners devs) to set their own entiity using bonding curve. We, as the team to build the platform, has no responsibility or control over their choice.

If we do not use bonding curve, we can directly calculate the weight of every TEA owner's dividends based on his layer2 TEA balance. This is equivlant to he has spend all his layer2 TEA token bought the Global token.

This is one potential problem. The goal of our system app is to show the bonding curve potential, if there is no bonding curve for those system app, there is no way to demo. So I think we can probably set the TAppStore to use this new non bonding curve dividend, but leave those other system tapps using bonding curve too.
