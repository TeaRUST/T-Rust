There are three types of entity based on their investment mode
- Solo
- Bonding curve
- None profit

Let's dive deep each of them

# Solo
The owner, e.g. the miner who own a CML node, do not allow others to invest to his CML. The owner owns 100% of all revenue, and also need to pay 100% deposit.

# Bonding curve
Unclear about whether it is a security token, but the owner wants to get other investors to join his venture. They can choose any kind of bonding curve. All token holders pays the deposit, taking risk and share the dividend. The owner has the priority to invest to his CML at first. He can also set the Theta value to gain additional income. All of this follow the bonding curve rule.

# None profit
All income of these nodes go to the DAO via the TAppStore accrued balance. There is no bonding curve or investment since no revenue to share. 

At the early stage, all state machine nodes are this kind of nodes. They give all revenue back to the DAO. The operation can get subsidy from [[UBI]] and [[general_admin_reserve]] to cover their cost.
