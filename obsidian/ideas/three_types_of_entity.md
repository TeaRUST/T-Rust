There are three types of entity based on their investment mode
- Private
- Tokenized
- Non-profit

Let's dive deep each of them

# Private
The owner, e.g. the miner who own a CML node, does not allow others to invest to their CML. The owner owns 100% of all revenue, and also needs to pay a deposit.

# Tokenized
Unclear about whether this would be a security token, but the owner wants to get other investors to join their venture. The owner chooses any kind of bonding curve. For CML tokens, all token holders' buy-ins are considered in aggregate as a deposit used to determine probability that a CML gets selected for a job. Everyone shares in the risks and the dividends. At the beginning, the owner has priority to invest to their CML. The CML owner can also set the Theta value to gain additional income. All of this follows the bonding curve rule.

# Non-profit
All income of these nodes goes to the DAO via the TAppStore accrued balance. There is no bonding curve or investment since there's no revenue to share. 

At the early stage, all state machine nodes are this kind of node. They give all revenue back to the DAO. The operation can get subsidy from [[node-subsidy]] and [[general_admin_reserve]] to cover their costs.
