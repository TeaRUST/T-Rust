I was asked so many times what to build once the TApp SDK and tutorial are ready. We have a lot of discussion in our community. Many of our community members have their own wonderful ideas........ Geroge please add

Yes, we can make a wiki page asking community members to vote, and we have made one .... link here.....

But wait, I have an even better idea.

Since we are software platform, why do not we make this idea (of gathering and vote for ideas) into an idea of TApp? Our first idea.

Ok, here is what we want this tapp to do:

- Everyone can post an idea, what tapp he wants to build. He will need to put at least 1 T as initial deposit
- Everyone can vote to support an idea by deposit at least 1T. This money will be put into the deposit. 
- Once voted, cannot withdraw but can increase deposit by vote again and add at least 1T again.
- The idea is sorted by the deposit count. The higher votes the higher position
- We do not have worker feature to complete task. So the task will be there once created. This feature may be added in the future

This is a typical easy web2 app. I bet everyone how to make it in a traditional web framework. Let's figure out how to make it a Web 3 app.
