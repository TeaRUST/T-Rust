This is a system buffer account. It stored the fund before paying to the Public Services and Global Token dividend.

At the end of every day, a cron job dump all fund from [Collection_Pool](Collection_Pool.md) to this Distribution_pool. If the balance is higher than the [Distribution_pool_overflow](Distribution_pool_overflow.md) (this number is subject to change), it will send exceed fund to [Global_bonding_curve](../harberger_tax/Global_bonding_curve.md) as dividend to all Global token investors. If the balance is lower than [Distribution_pool_overflow](Distribution_pool_overflow.md), see [Corner_cases > Distribution pool cannot cover public service](Corner_cases.md#distribution-pool-cannot-cover-public-service)
