This is a system buffer account. It stored the fund before paying to the Public Services and Global Token dividend.

At the end of every day, a cron job dump all fund from [Collection Pool](../Collection%20Pool.md) to this Distribution_pool. If the balance is higher than the 1000T (this number is subject to change), it will send exceed fund to [Global_bonding_curve](../harberger_tax/Global_bonding_curve.md) as dividend to all Global token investors. If the balance is lower than 1000T, the sudo will transfer the difference from [Genesis_block_miner_reward_reserve](Genesis_block_miner_reward_reserve.md) to keep the balance to 1000T. In this case, there is no dividend for today.
