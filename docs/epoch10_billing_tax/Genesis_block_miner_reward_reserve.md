To cold start the TEA ecosystem, we will need to reserve some pre-mined TEA in the Genesis Block. At early stage there are not enough tapp to pay for transaction and memory tax. The [Collection Pool](../Collection%20Pool.md) won't have enough fund to support the Public Service. We will need this reserved TEA token to pay the public service.

The balance is limited, so if the fund run out, it run out. We think we will have enough income to cover the public service before this fund runs out.
