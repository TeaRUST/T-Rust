Tier means the [state_broadcast > State broadcast tiers](state_broadcast.md#state-broadcast-tiers). 

Any [hosting_nodes](hosting_nodes.md) wants to get state update and cache locally need to get some tier of seat. The higher the tier, the earlier to receive the state update.

The seat is limited public resources, like other limited public resources, we use the [harberger tax](harberger%20tax.md) design.

The seat is on auction all the time. Whoever pay higher than the claimed price will get it. The owner of seat need to pay tax to the Global token.
