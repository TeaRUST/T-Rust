The consensus of TEA Project doesn't require hash power but does require a trusted computing chip (e.g. TPM) and a source for true-time (such as a GPS receiver). Simply put, TEA Project use the timestamp generated by atomic clocks to reach global consensus instead of relying on a hash competition. To keep the timestamp trustable and the computing data secure, we require all computing logic to run inside of enclaves protected by trusted computing hardware. This environment can be verified by peer to peer remote attestation.
