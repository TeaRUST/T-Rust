The consensus of TEA Project doen't require hash power, but trusted computing chip (e.g. TPM) and source to true-time(e.g. GPS receiver). Simply put, TEA Project use the timestamp generated in atomic clock to reach global consensus instead of hash competition. To keep the timestamp trustable and the computing data security, we require all computing logics run inside enclaves protected by trusted computing hardware. This environment can be verified by peer to peer remote attestation.
