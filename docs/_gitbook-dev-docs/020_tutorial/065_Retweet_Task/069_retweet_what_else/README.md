Billing related to secure oracle. George, you can asnwer like this: The developer of the secure oracle actor may have their own pricing model. TEA Project will help billing.

In the runtime the TEA Project will measure the usage and enforce the payment.

Note, this feature is not completed at the time of writing. 

If you write a seure oracle actor and published to the TEA Project, you are the owner of this NFT. All actors are NFT in TEA Project. You can also publish your pricing policy that follow the TEA Project billing rules. If some other application calls your secure oracle, the TEA billing system will measure and enforce the payment from the caller. So you can learn the passive income by providing such secure oracle actor. Please note, this is NOT gas fee. It is just the actor usage fee or in-app purchase. Gas fee is computing resource cost pay to the miners.
