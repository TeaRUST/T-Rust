# Introduction

Developing a TApp is very similar to developing a typical web2 application. You do not need to learn smart contract, or understand the concept of distributed system. But there are still many differences. This tutorial is here to help you overcome those challenges. 

During this tutorial, we will step by step build a simple TApplication. It is called **Tutor-v1"**. It looks a typical "todo list" example we have seen so many times in various web framework tutotiral. But we have a little improvement. The worker who complete  task will get paid by the owner who created such a task.

During our tutorial, we will 

* Setup the development environment. 
* Clone from the boilerplate. 
* Test locally using dev-runner.
* Deploy to the testnet
* Gradually add features to the app
* Summary

After following the full tutorial, you should be able to create your own TApps by adding your own business logic to the boilerplace. But you may need more detail explanation, you will need to read our development document.

## Try before build

This tutorial will culminate in building a decentralized gig task app similar to Fiverr.com. Before actually taking all the steps to build the app, users can run the app on our AWS Nitro deployment at http://43.201.23.47:8080/ipfs/QmberYsF6kSVbrxzp1DZuMtcZTfvCWG13ZePLi4PVcHyY8/#/discover

Just login with your Ethereum account using Metamask and click on **tutorial-v1** to start the app.

Instructions to use this app are explained [elsewhere in the tutorial](020_tutorial/060_reward_fund_transfer/README.md).
