# Introduction

Developing a TApp is very similar to developing a typical web2 application. You don't need to learn smart contracts, or understand the concept of distributed systems. But there are still many differences. This tutorial is here to help you overcome these challenges. 

During this tutorial, we'll build a simple TApplication step by step. It's called **Tutor-v1**. It looks like a typical "todo list" example we have seen so many times in various web framework tutorials but we have a bit of an improvement. The worker who completes a task will get paid by the owner who created the task.

During our tutorial, we will:

* Setup the development environment. 
* Clone from the boilerplate. 
* Test locally using `dev-runner`.
* Deploy to the testnet.
* Gradually add features to the app.
* Summarize what we've accomplished.

After following the full tutorial, you should be able to create your own TApps by adding your own business logic to the boilerplate.
