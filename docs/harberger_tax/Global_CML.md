Global CML used to be called type A CML. It is the license to run a [[Global_state_maintainer_nodes]]. Because every Global state node is the same. So there is no different between every Global CML, but it is still a NFT, beause it cannot be splited into fraction. 

Every Global CML has a [[self_estimate_price]] and trade freely in the marketplace.
