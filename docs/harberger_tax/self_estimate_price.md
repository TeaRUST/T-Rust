Based on the Harberger tax theory, anyone who owns a [Maintainer seat](epoch10_billing_tax/Maintainer_Seat.md) (used to type A CML)need to give his CML a self estiamte value. He will need to pay income tax based on this value. Anyone else who can pay higher than this price can take over this CML without prior agreed by the current owner. A short notice and grace period may apply. 

The value is this Global CML's self estimate price.

# Note on the self estimate price
The maintainer can set any value of the CML he owns. But if he set it too high, he may need to pay more [[maintainer_tax]]. If he set it too low, someone else will pay this price and take away his CML.

So the maintainer will usualy set to a price that make reasonable profit while discourage other miners to take away his CML.
