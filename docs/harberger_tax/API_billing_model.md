Dev can set a price for the API that calls his own actor.

If the caller is another actor or front end owned by the same developer, there is no need to pay.

If the caller is a 3rd party application, the owner of that applicaiton need to pay the price. This is the revenue to the owner developer.

As long as the code runs, it will consume some sort of computing resources provided by the miners. The TEA Project billing system will measure the usage using  [Computing_resource_billing_model](Computing_resource_billing_model.md) bill the owner of the code to the miners. This is the cost of the owner developer.
