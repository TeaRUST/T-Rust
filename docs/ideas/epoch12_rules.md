## Epoch 11

* TEA\<\>COFFEE Uniswap LP on Goerli setup by team for contestants to use.
* Any TEA in contestants wallets (layer-1 and layer-2) rolls over to Epoch 12.
* Any bonding curve assets will be proportionally calculated for each user, the TEA value of which gets rolled over to Epoch 12.
* Any deposits for state maintainer seats will get rolled over to Epoch 12 in TAppStore wallet.
* Any COFFEE, whether purchased by themselves through the form, carried over from previous epoch, or converted themselves via the Uniswap LP, will get carried over at a ratio of 1:1.2 (i.e. a 20% bonus) into Epoch 12.
* COFFEE can still be cashed out to BUSD before Epoch 12 starts. Please note, you need to make decision to cash out or roll-over **before** Epoch 12 starts. Once the roll-over to Epoch 12 has begun, the cash out option will be gone forever.
* Once epoch12 starts and into the future, all COFFEE can convert to discounted mainnet TEA tokens when the mainnet starts. More detail on this later.
* We should emphasize to contestants that the asset they want is COFFEE not TEA, i.e. TEA is just a means to get COFFEE which is what they want to get discounted mainnet tokens. 
* We can reward a small amount of COFFEE for Epoch 11 contestants but nothing was promised to them especially as this is a transitional epoch.

## Epoch 12

* Team does **not** setup Uniswap LP for TEA\<\>COFFEE, meaning COFFEE is a terminal voucher for discounted mainnet TEA.
* Team will setup Goerli ETH \<\>TEA on Uniswap. 
* There is no COFFEE (half half with TEA) initialized to contestants any more. For those decide to roll over COFFEE will have their COFFEE (with 20% bonus) in their Goerli wallet. 
* There's no longer a Google form to buy COFFEE with USDT, just as there's no longer a COFFEE cash-out option once Epoch 12 starts. 
* For those TEA token rolled over from Epoch 11, they'll appear in the contestant's TApp Store wallet when Epoch 12 starts. 
* Total reward pool for COFFEE in Epoch 12 will be 1000 COFFEE( The actual number is still to be determined. It may be a variable based on how many contestants join the leaderboard). The reward will be distributed proportionally based on the net gain shown in the leaderboard. Only the position based on net gain will be considered valid. Those rewarded COFFEE will be sent to contesters COFFEE balance. The minimal COFFEE reward is 1 COFFEE. If your reward is less than 1 COFFEE, it is ignored.
* **Note**\*: we should re-do leaderboard to rank based on net gain if that is going to be the reward determination.
* All TEA / TEA-equivalent assets will be wiped clean at end of Epoch 12. When next epoch starts, everyone will starts from zero TEA balance.
* All contesters COFFEE assets will be kept and accumulated until the mainnet starts. They can use their COFFEE to exchange for discounted mainnet TEA token as a reward for their testing work. This is **not** airdrop. It's a reward for their hard work. 
* Miners will be given a subsidy to compete. The amount will be communicated with influencers, and their followers will need to DM one of the TG moderators to help setup their node (provide instructions, generate machine id etc.)
* **Question**: can we run nodes for users and give them a smaller subsidy since mainnet will involve us running nodes for endusers (AWS Nitro for state machine nodes)?

## Epoch 13

* No TEA is rolled over from previous epoch.
* No COFFEE transfers are allowed to any other stable coin to redeem, convert, cash out.
* All contesters COFFEE will stay in their own Goerli wallet.
* Team will not setup COFFEE \<\> TEA exchange.
* At the end of epoch 13, all TEA assets will be clear and reset. Contesters will get COFFEE reward at the end. There might be a new reward plan.
