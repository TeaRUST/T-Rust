If we deploy to AWS Nitro when mainnet starts. The cost of every min Nitro is a little more than $108. So we can make sure our RA reward can cover the cost.

We can run a ETH price checker from Uniswap to get the price of TEA in USDT. Calculate how much TEA can cover $108. That TEA would be the minimal RA reward to cover the Nitro cost.

At early stage, if there is no other income of Nitro miner, the RA reward might be the only income to the miners. And in worst case that not a lot of apps provide tax income, and the TEA price is low, there would be a lot of TEA paid to the RA cost. So this is a bad sceanario.

To minimize the chance of the worst case, we should limit the CML seeds at the beginning. If less CMLs share the RA reward, the cost can be still under control. So the price of CML seeds can be set to a rather high level. 

If someone buy the seeds, the purchase money goes to TAppStore. We should not share the dividend immediately to all TEA hold4s. We should control the release to dividend slowly. So that those fund from sales of seeds can be used to pay public server (RA). In order to do ths, we should setup a rule that only a certain percentage of accured balance to be paid as dividend. For example, 50% and also leave at least 1T after dividend paid.
