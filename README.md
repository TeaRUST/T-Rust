# T-Rust


Updated on Aug 2021. We did not remove this repo even it has nothing in it. Because this is the first repo we created for the TEA Project (it was called T-rust at that moment). We would like to keep it as the corner stone of TEA Project. The functionality of this repo is currently taken by the tea-project repo https://github.com/tearust/teaproject
